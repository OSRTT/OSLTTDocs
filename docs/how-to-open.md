The back cover (the one with the USB port) slides upwards. Keep it parallel and be gentle!

Once the back cover is off, unclip the button cap, then slide the top cover forward over the button. Again keep it parallel as you slide it.

Finally, slide the main PCB out the back side (away from the switch side).
