## Game Test Mode
If you want to test games, you can hit the game mode, hit start test, then fire up a game. In my case I’m going with CSGO. It needs a recent light level difference, so I like to stand by these metal signs and have it shoot at the signs which produces a much brighter flash than the pistol itself. If a game has NVIDIA’s Reflex marker, that will work great too. Again by default once you hit the button on the device it’ll auto-fire. I go with 20 shots here as that’s the size of the pistol magazine in CSGO. If you auto-fire it should automatically end the test, or you can turn auto click off and just press the button to single fire instead.
