# Building from Source
{: .no_toc }


It shouldn't be too difficult for you to get the source code running - there are a few things you should know though!

## Arduino CLI

You'll need to put a copy of the [Arduino CLI](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli) in the bin/debug or bin/releases folder, inside a folder named "arduinoCLI". If you want the code to be able to push updates to the board you'll also need to copy the "OSRTT_Full_Code" folder from the Hardware folder to the "arduinoCLI" folder as well.
