# Building from Source
{: .no_toc }


It shouldn't be too difficult for you to get the source code running - there are a few things you should know though!
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }


## Arduino CLI

You'll need to put a copy of the [Arduino CLI](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli) in the bin/debug or bin/releases folder, inside a folder named "arduinoCLI".

## Remove Signed Builds

You'll also need to head to the solution properties and disabled signed builds before it'll build.
