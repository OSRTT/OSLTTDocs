# Measuring Latency
{: .no_toc }

## Audio Test Mode
Stick the microphone in the ear cup of the headset you want to test - or in front of your speakers, whatever you’re testing - then make sure the volume is turned up as high as it’ll go. The louder the beep, the clearer the results will be. To start, hit the button on the device. By default this will run 30 times - although you can increase that up to 500 if you want to go that kind of mad. Once it’s complete it will pop up the results viewer with all the data for you.
