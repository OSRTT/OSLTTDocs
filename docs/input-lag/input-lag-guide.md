# Peripheral Latency Guide
### Version 1.0, last update 27 August 2023
{: .no_toc }

## Introduction
I want to preface this by saying that this project is still in its early stages. What you see here may change over time as I fix bugs, add new features and improve the tool. If you have any questions please do leave them in the comments, on the <a href="https://github.com/OSRTT/OSLTT/">Github repo</a>, ping me <a href="mailto:inbox@techteamgb.com">an email</a> or even jump on our <a href="https://discord.gg/enAgKTbZ3b">Discord.</a> If you don’t happen to have an open source latency testing tool but you want one, head to <a href="https://osrtt.com/osltt">OSRTT.com</a> and pick one up. Right, let’s get into the tool.

## UPDATE REGARDING 2 PIN TESTING MODE
If you bought an OSLTT unit that shipped before the 22nd of November 2023, you'll need to solder a 1M ohm resistor in line with the signal pin (the one with the label) to get accurate results. This issue was corrected in all units after 22/11/2023.
