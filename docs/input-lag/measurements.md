# Measuring Latency

## Peripheral (Mouse and Keyboard) Test Mode
You’ll need the microphone connected to the device - and here’s the important bit. The mic needs to be right up to the device you’re testing. Right next to the left click button on a mouse, or next to the keyboard key you’re going to press. Select the mouse and keyboard mode, hit start test, then click in the box or type in the text box below. Make your clicks and keypresses nice and loud, like this. Do as many clicks as you want - the more you do the more accurate the final results will be. Once you’re done, click the orange button on the top of the device to end the test. Clicking “end test” will technically work too, but at the moment that will soft-lock the device and you’ll need to unplug and reconnect it. I’m working on that. You should then see the results viewer pop up with the data. What shows up here is subject to change - but in short you should see a graph with the click times average, min and max, and if you hit “switch to individual results” you’ll see the scatter plot with each individual data point. You can also save the charts as images, either with a transparent or white background.
